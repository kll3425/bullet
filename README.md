Cyber Defense Techniques HW 4 - Red Team Tool

A distraction tool that creates persistant image pop-ups.

This tool creates a pop-up image of a bullethole on the screen with a pew-pew sound effect. The pop-up cannot be moved or closed and generates 2-6 more pop-ups in random locations on the screen. These pop-ups stay on top of all windows and persist until the program is closed.

To run this program, the machine will need python and the tkinter, random, and playsound python packages installed.
